Delete Product: Implement the deleteProduct method to remove a product based on its ID.
Enhancements and Refinements: Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for edge cases, such as invalid inputs or database operations.
**Technologies Used**:
Core Java: Java serves as the primary programming language for developing the application logic and GUI components.
Java Swing:JFrame: Provides the main application window.
JLabel: Displays text labels (e.g., "Username:", "Password:", messages).
JTextField: Allows users to input text (e.g., username).
JPasswordField: Allows users to input passwords securely.
